# Number-Guessing-Game and Understaing the DOM Manipulation
A simple web-based game that allows the player to guess a random number. If the player correctly guesses the number, they win the game and can keep track of their high score. If not, they lose and can try again.
In this project, I extensively utilized DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. The primary techniques used include:

1. querySelector
querySelector was employed to select HTML elements using CSS selectors, allowing me to easily target and manipulate specific parts of the page. For instance, I used it to select the input field where the player enters their guess and the button to submit their guess.
2. getElementById
I utilized getElementById to access elements with unique identifiers directly. This is particularly useful when you have elements with specific, distinct IDs.
3. Dynamic HTML and CSS Changes
DOM manipulation enabled me to dynamically change the content and appearance of the web page based on game events. For example, when a player wins or loses, I used DOM manipulation to update the text and styles.
